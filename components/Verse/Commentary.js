        The two armies had gathered on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, well
        prepared to fight a war that was inevitable. Still, in this verse, King
        Dhritarashtra asked Sanjay, what his sons and his brother Pandu’s sons
        were doing on the battlefield? It was apparent that they would fight,
        then why did he ask such a question?
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 mx-auto text-left dark:text-gray-50">
        The blind King Dhritarashtra’s fondness for his own sons had clouded his
        spiritual wisdom and deviated him from the path of virtue. He had
        usurped the kingdom of Hastinapur from the rightful heirs; the Pandavas,
        sons of his brother Pandu. Feeling guilty of the injustice he had done
        towards his nephews, his conscience worried him about the outcome of
        this battle.

        The words dharma kṣhetre, the land of dharma (virtuous conduct) used by
        Dhritarashtra depict the dilemma he was experiencing. Kurukshetra is
        described as kurukṣhetraṁ deva yajanam in the Shatapath Brahman, the
        Vedic textbook detailing rituals. It means “Kurukshetra is the
        sacrificial arena of the celestial gods.” Hence, it was regarded as the
        sacred land that nourished dharma.

      <p className="mt-4 mx-auto text-left dark:text-gray-50">
        Dhritarashtra feared that the holy land might influence the minds of his
        sons. If it aroused the faculty of discrimination, they might turn away
        from killing their cousins and negotiate a truce. A peaceful settlement
        meant that the Pandavas would continue being a hindrance for them. He
        felt great displeasure at these possibilities, instead preferred that
        this war transpires. He was uncertain of the consequences of the war,
        yet desired to determine the fate of his sons. Therefore, he asked
        Sanjay about the activities of the two armies on the battleground.
