  "Whenever dharma declines and the purpose of life is forgotten, I manifest myself on earth. I am born in every age to protect the good, to destroy evil, and to reestablish dharma.",
  "As they approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me.",
  "I am the beginning, middle, and end of creation.",
  "Among animals I am the lion; among birds, the eagle Garuda. I am Prahlada, born among the demons, and of all that measures, I am time.",
  "I am death, which overcomes all, and the source of all beings still to be born.",
  "Just remember that I am, and that I support the entire cosmos with only a fragment of my being.",
  "Behold, Arjuna, a million divine forms, with an infinite variety of color and shape. Behold the gods of the natural world, and many more wonders never revealed before. Behold the entire cosmos turning within my body, and the other things you desire to see.",
  "I am time, the destroyer of all; I have come to consume the world.",
  "That one is dear to me who runs not after the pleasant or away from the painful, grieves not, lusts not, but lets things come and go as they happen.",
  "Just as a reservoir is of little use when the whole countryside is flooded, scriptures are of little use to the illumined man or woman, who sees the Lord everywhere.",
  "They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal.",
  "With a drop of my energy I enter the earth and support all creatures. Through the moon, the vessel of life-giving fluid, I nourish all plants. I enter breathing creatures and dwell within as the life-giving breath. I am the fire in the stomach which digests all food.",
  "There are three gates to this self-destructive hell: lust, anger, and greed. Renounce these three.",
  "Pleasure from the senses seems like nectar at first, but it is bitter as poison in the end.",
  "That which seems like poison at first, but tastes like nectar in the end - this is the joy of sattva, born of a mind at peace with itself.",
  "The Lord dwells in the hearts of all creatures and whirls them round upon the wheel of maya. Run to him for refuge with all your strength, and peace profound will be yours through his grace.",
  "Whatever you do, make it an offering to me - the food you eat, the sacrifices you make, the help you give, even your suffering.",
  "I am heat; I give and withhold the rain. I am immortality and I am death; I am what is and what is not.",
  "Those who worship other gods with faith and devotion also worship me, Arjuna, even if they do not observe the usual forms. I am the object of all worship, its enjoyer and Lord.",
  "Those who remember me at the time of death will come to me. Do not doubt this. Whatever occupies the mind at the time of death determines the destination of the dying; always they will tend toward that state of being.",
  "When meditation is mastered, the mind is unwavering like the flame of a lamp in a windless place.",
  "They are forever free who renounce all selfish desires and break away from the egocage of 'I', 'me', and 'mine' to be united with the Lord. This is the supreme state. Attain to this, and pass from death to immortality.",
  "They live in wisdom who see themselves in all and all in them, who have renounced every selfish desire and sense-craving tormenting the heart.",
  "The meaning of Karma is in the intention. The intention behind action is what matters. Those who are motivated only by desire for the fruits of action are miserable, for they are constantly anxious about the results of what they do.",
  "You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction.",
  "Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself - without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind.",
  "At the beginning of time I declared two paths for the pure heart: jnana yoga, the contemplative path of spiritual wisdom, and karma yoga, the active path of selfless service. There are the fundamental different types of yoga.",
  "Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind. It was by such work that Janaka attained perfection; others too have followed this path.",
  "There is nothing in the three worlds for me to gain, Arjuna, nor is there anything I do not have; I continue to act, but I am not driven by any need of my own.",
  "The ignorant work for their own profit, Arjuna; the wise work for the welfare of the world, without thought for themselves.",
  "It is better to strive in one's own dharma than to succeed in the dharma of another. Nothing is ever lost in following one's own dharma, but competition in another's dharma breeds fear and insecurity.",
  "The senses are higher than the body, the mind higher than the senses; above the mind is the intellect, and above the intellect is the Atman. Thus, knowing that which is supreme, let the Atman rule the ego. Use your mighty arms to slay the fierce enemy that is selfish desire.",
  "You and I have passed through many births, Arjuna. You have forgotten, but I remember them all.",
  "My true being is unborn and changeless. I am the Lord who dwells in every creature. Through the power of my own maya, I manifest myself in a finite form.",
  "Those who know me as their own divine Self break through the belief that they are the body and are not reborn as separate creatures. Such a one, Arjuna, is united with me.",
  "Delivered from selfish attachment, fear, and anger, filled with me, surrendering themselves to me, purified in the fire of my being, many have reached the state of unity in me.",
  "Actions do not cling to me because I am not attached to their results. Those who understand this and practice it live in freedom.",
  "The wise see that there is action in the midst of inaction and inaction in the midst of action. Their consciousness is unified, and every act is done with complete awareness.",
  "The process of offering is Brahman; that which is offered is Brahman. Brahman offers the sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. Brahman is attained by those who see Brahman in every action.",
  "The offering of wisdom is better than any material offering, Arjuna; for the goal of all work is spiritual wisdom.",
  "Approach those who have realized the purpose of life and question them with reverence and devotion; they will instruct you in this wisdom.",
  "Even if you were the most sinful of sinners, Arjuna, you could cross beyond all sin by the raft of spiritual wisdom.",
  "Krishna delivers the Gita to Arjuna.",
  "As the heat of a fire reduces wood to ashes, the fire of knowledge burns to ashes all karma.",
  "Those who surrender to Brahman all selfish attachments are like the leaf of a lotus floating clean and dry in water. Sin cannot touch them.",
  "Those who renounce attachment in all their deeds live content in the 'city of nine gates', the body, as its master. They are not driven to act, nor do they involve others in action.",
  "Those who possess this wisdom have equal regard for all. They see the same Self in a spiritual aspirant and an outcaste, in an elephant, a cow, and a dog.",
  "Pleasures conceived in the world of the senses have a beginning and an end and give birth to misery, Arjuna. The wise do not look for happiness in them. But those who overcome the impulses of lust and anger which arise in the body are made whole and live in joy. They find their joy, their rest, and their light completely within themselves. United with the Lord, they attain nirvana in Brahman.",
  "Free from anger and selfish desire, unified in mind, those who follow the path of yoga and realize the Self are established forever in that supreme state.",
  "Knowing me as the friend of all creatures, the Lord of the universe, the end of all offerings and all spiritual disciplines, they attain eternal peace.",
  "It is not those who lack energy or refrain from action, but those who work without expectation of reward who attain the goal of meditation.",
  "Those who cannot renounce attachment to the results of their work are far from the path.",
  "Reshape yourself through the power of your will; never let yourself be degraded by self-will. The will is the only friend of the Self, and the will is the only enemy of the Self.",
  "To those who have conquered themselves, the will is a friend. But it is the enemy of those who have not found the Self within them.",
  "The supreme Reality stands revealed in the consciousness of those who have conquered themselves. They live in peace, alike in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, praise and blame.",
  "With all fears dissolved in the peace of the Self and all actions dedicated to Brahman, controlling the mind and fixing it on me, sit in meditation with me as your only goal.",
  "Arjuna, those who eat too much or eat too little, who sleep too much or sleep too little, will not succeed in meditation. But those who are temperate in eating and sleeping, work and recreation, will come to the end of sorrow through meditation.",
  "In the still mind, in the depths of meditation, the Self reveals itself. Beholding the Self by means of the Self, an aspirant knows the joy and peace of complete fulfillment.",
  "Wherever the mind wanders, restless and diffuse in its search for satisfaction without, lead it within; train it to rest in the Self.",
  "I am ever present to those who have realized me in every creature. Seeing all life as my manifestation, they are never separated from me.",
  "When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union.",
  "No one who does good work will ever come to a bad end, either here or in the world to come.",
  "Through constant effort over many lifetimes, a person becomes purified of all selfish desires and attains the supreme goal of life.",
  "Meditation is superior to severe asceticism and the path of knowledge. It is also superior to selfless service. May you attain the goal of meditation, Arjuna!.",
  "Even among those who meditate, that man or woman who worships me with perfect faith, completely absorbed in me, is the most firmly established in yoga.",
  "With your mind intent on me, Arjuna, discipline yourself with the practice of yoga. Depend on me completely. Listen, and I will dispel all your doubts; you will come to know me fully and be united with me.",
  "The birth and dissolution of the cosmos itself take place in me. There is nothing that exists separate from me, Arjuna. The entire universe is suspended from me as my necklace of jewels.",
  "Arjuna, I am the taste of pure water and the radiance of the sun and moon. I am the sacred word and the sound heard in air, and the courage of human beings. I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the radiance of fire; I am the life in every creature and the striving of the spiritual aspirant.",
  "My eternal seed, Arjuna, is to be found in every creature. I am the power of discrimination in those who are intelligent, and the glory of the noble. In those who are strong, I am strength, free from passion and selfish attachment. I am desire itself, if that desire is in harmony with the purpose of life.",
  "The states of sattva, rajas, and tamas come from me, but I am not in them.",
  "The three gunas make up my divine maya, difficult to overcome. But they cross over this maya who take refuge in me.",
  "Some come to the spiritual life because of suffering, some in order to understand life; some come through a desire to achieve life's purpose, and some come who are men and women of wisdom. Unwavering in devotion, always united with me, the man or woman of wisdom surpasses all the others.",
  "After many births the wise seek refuge in me, seeing me everywhere and in everything. Such great souls are very rare.",
  "The world, deluded, does not know that I am without birth and changeless. I know everything about the past, the present, and the future, Arjuna; but there is no one who knows me completely.",
  "Delusion arises from the duality of attraction and aversion, Arjuna; every creature is deluded by these from birth.",
  "Those who see me ruling the cosmos, who see me in the adhibhuta, the adhidaiva, and the adhiyajna, are conscious of me even at the time of death.",
  "The Lord is the supreme poet, the first cause, the sovereign ruler, subtler than the tiniest particle, the support of all, inconceivable, bright as the sun, beyond darkness.",
  "Remembering me at the time of death, close down the doors of the senses and place the mind in the heart. Then, while absorbed in meditation, focus all energy upwards to the head. Repeating in this state the divine name, the syllable Om that represents the changeless Brahman, you will go forth from the body and attain the supreme goal.",
  "I am easily attained by the person who always remembers me and is attached to nothing else. Such a person is a true yogi, Arjuna.",
  "Every creature in the universe is subject to rebirth, Arjuna, except the one who is united with me.",
  "The six months of the northern path of the sun, the path of light, of fire, of day, of the bright fortnight, leads knowers of Brahman to the supreme goal. The six months of the southern path of the sun, the path of smoke, of night, of the dark fortnight, leads other souls to the light of the moon and to rebirth.",
  "Under my watchful eye the laws of nature take their course. Thus is the world set in motion; thus the animate and the inanimate are created.",
  "I am the ritual and the sacrifice; I am true medicine and the mantram. I am the offering and the fire which consumes it, and the one to whom it is offered.",
  "I am the father and mother of this universe, and its grandfather too; I am its entire support. I am the sum of all knowledge, the purifier, the syllable Om; I am the sacred scriptures, the Rig, Yajur, and Sama Vedas.",
  "I am the goal of life, the Lord and support of all, the inner witness, the abode of all. I am the only refuge, the one true friend; I am the beginning, the staying, and the end of creation; I am the womb and the eternal seed.",
  "Those who follow the rituals given in the Vedas, who offer sacrifices and take soma, free themselves from evil and attain the vast heaven of the gods, where they enjoy celestial pleasures. When they have enjoyed these fully, their merit is exhausted and they return to this land of death. Thus observing Vedic rituals but caught in an endless chain of desires, they come and go.",
  "Those who worship me and meditate on me constantly, without any other thought - I will provide for all their needs.",
  "Those who worship the devas will go to the realm of the devas; those who worship their ancestors will be united with them after death. Those who worship phantoms will become phantoms; but my devotees will come to me. Those who worship the devas will go to the realm of the devas; those who worship their ancestors will be united with them after death. Those who worship phantoms will become phantoms; but my devotees will come to me.",
  "Fill your mind with me; love me; serve me; worship me always. Seeking me in your heart, you will at last be united with me.",
  "All the scriptures lead to me; I am their author and their wisdom.",
  "Bhishma, Drona, Jayadratha, Karna, and many others are already slain. Kill those whom I have killed. Do not hesitate. Fight in this battle and you will conquer your enemies.",
  "Not by knowledge of the Vedas, nor sacrifice, nor charity, nor rituals, nor even by severe asceticism has any other mortal seen what you have seen, O heroic Arjuna.",
  "Better indeed is knowledge than mechanical practice. Better than knowledge is meditation. But better still is surrender of attachment to results, because there follows immediate peace.",
  "Some realize the Self within them through the practice of meditation, some by the path of wisdom, and others by selfless service. Others may not know these paths; but hearing and following the instructions of an illumined teacher, they too go beyond death.",
  "The brightness of the sun, which lights up the world, the brightness of the moon and of fire - these are my glory.",
  "Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint, and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind.",
  "To refrain from selfish acts is one kind of renunciation, called sannyasa; to renounce the fruit of action is another, called tyaga.",
  "By serving me with steadfast love, a man or woman goes beyond the gunas. Such a one is fit for union with Brahman.",
  "When they see the variety of creation rooted in that unity and growing out of it, they attain fulfillment in Brahman.",
  "I have shared this profound truth with you, Arjuna. Those who understand it will attain wisdom; they will have done that which has to be done.",
  "I give you these precious words of wisdom; reflect on them and then do as you choose.",

    "जब जब धर्म की हानि और अधर्म की वृद्धि होती है, तब तब मैं स्वयं को प्रकट करता हूं। साधुओं की रक्षा और दुष्टों के विनाश के लिए, तथा धर्म की पुनः स्थापना के लिए मैं युग-युग में जन्म लेता हूं।",
    "जो भक्त मुझे जिस भाव से पुकारते हैं, मैं उन्हें उसी भाव से प्राप्त होता हूं। हे अर्जुन, सभी मार्ग अंततः मुझ तक ही पहुंचते हैं।",

    "मैं सबको नष्ट करने वाली मृत्यु हूं और उत्पन्न होने वाले प्राणियों का कारण भी मैं ही हूं।",
    "यह जान लो कि मैं अपनी शक्ति के एक अंश मात्र से इस संपूर्ण जगत को धारण किए हुए हूं।",
    "हे अर्जुन, देखो मेरे लाखों दिव्य रूपों को, विविध रंगों और आकृतियों में। प्रकृति के देवताओं को देखो और उन अद्भुत रूपों को देखो जो पहले कभी प्रकट नहीं हुए। मेरे शरीर में घूमते हुए संपूर्ण ब्रह्मांड को देखो।",
    "मैं काल हूं, संसार को नष्ट करने वाला। मैं यहां जगत को संहार करने आया हूं।",
    "वह व्यक्ति मुझे प्रिय है जो सुख के पीछे नहीं भागता और न दुख से डरता है, जो न शोक करता है, न लालच करता है, बल्कि चीजों को आने-जाने देता है।",
    "जैसे सब ओर से बाढ़ आने पर छोटा तालाब बेकार हो जाता है, वैसे ही ज्ञानी पुरुष के लिए सभी वेदों का उतना ही प्रयोजन रह जाता है जितना सर्वत्र परिपूर्ण जल में तालाब का।",
    "जो सभी प्राणियों में समान रूप से परमात्मा को देखता है, नश्वर में अविनाशी को देखता है, वही सच्चा ज्ञानी है। सर्वत्र समान आत्मा को देखकर वह न स्वयं को हानि पहुंचाता है न दूसरों को, इस प्रकार वह परम लक्ष्य को प्राप्त करता है।",
    "मैं अपनी शक्ति के एक अंश से पृथ्वी में प्रवेश कर सभी प्राणियों को धारण करता हूं। चंद्रमा के रूप में सभी वनस्पतियों का पोषण करता हूं। प्राणियों में प्रवेश कर जीवन-शक्ति बनकर रहता हूं। पेट में अग्नि बनकर भोजन को पचाता हूं।",
    "नरक के तीन द्वार हैं: काम, क्रोध और लोभ। इन तीनों को त्याग दो।",
    "इंद्रियों से मिलने वाला सुख पहले अमृत के समान प्रतीत होता है, परंतु अंत में विष के समान हो जाता है।",
    "जो पहले विष के समान प्रतीत होता है परंतु अंत में अमृत के समान होता है - यह सात्विक आनंद है, जो शांत मन से उत्पन्न होता है।",
    "भगवान सभी प्राणियों के हृदय में निवास करते हैं और अपनी माया से उन्हें चक्र पर घुमाते हैं। हे अर्जुन, पूर्ण शक्ति से उनकी शरण में जाओ, उनकी कृपा से तुम्हें परम शांति और शाश्वत धाम प्राप्त होगा।",
    "जो कुछ भी तुम करो, उसे मुझे अर्पण करो - जो भोजन तुम खाते हो, जो यज्ञ करते हो, जो दान देते हो, यहां तक कि तुम्हारा कष्ट भी।",
    "मैं ही गर्मी हूं; मैं ही वर्षा देता और रोकता हूं। मैं अमरता हूं और मैं ही मृत्यु हूं; मैं सत् भी हूं और असत् भी हूं।",
    "जो अन्य देवताओं की श्रद्धा और भक्ति से पूजा करते हैं, वे भी मेरी ही पूजा करते हैं, भले ही वे सामान्य विधि का पालन न करें। मैं ही सभी पूजा का लक्ष्य, भोक्ता और स्वामी हूं।",
    "जो मृत्यु के समय मुझे स्मरण करता है, वह मुझे प्राप्त होता है। इसमें कोई संदेह नहीं। मृत्यु के समय जिस भाव को स्मरण करता है, वही भाव उसे प्राप्त होता है।",
    "जब ध्यान सिद्ध हो जाता है, तब मन निर्वात स्थान में दीपक की लौ की तरह स्थिर हो जाता है।",
    "जो सभी स्वार्थी इच्छाओं का त्याग कर 'मैं', 'मेरा', 'मुझे' के पिंजरे से मुक्त होकर भगवान के साथ एक हो जाते हैं, वे सदा के लिए स्वतंत्र हो जाते हैं। यह परम अवस्था है। इसे प्राप्त करो और मृत्यु से अमरता की ओर जाओ।",
    "वे ज्ञान में जीते हैं जो स्वयं को सब में और सब को स्वयं में देखते हैं, जिन्होंने हृदय को पीड़ा देने वाली सभी स्वार्थी इच्छाओं और इंद्रिय-लालसाओं का त्याग कर दिया है।",
    "कर्म का अर्थ उसकी नीयत में है। कर्म के पीछे की नीयत ही महत्वपूर्ण है। जो केवल कर्म के फल की इच्छा से प्रेरित होते हैं, वे दुखी रहते हैं, क्योंकि वे अपने कर्मों के परिणाम की चिंता में सदा व्याकुल रहते हैं।",
    "तुम्हें केवल कर्म करने का अधिकार है, फल पर कभी नहीं। तुम्हें कभी कर्म के फल की इच्छा से प्रेरित नहीं होना चाहिए, और न ही कर्म न करने की इच्छा करनी चाहिए।",
    "हे अर्जुन, इस संसार में कर्म करो, परंतु आत्मा में स्थित होकर - स्वार्थी आसक्ति के बिना, और सफलता-असफलता में समान रहकर। यही योग है - मन की पूर्ण समता।",
    "समय के आरंभ में मैंने शुद्ध हृदय के लिए दो मार्ग घोषित किए: ज्ञान योग, आध्यात्मिक ज्ञान का चिंतनशील मार्ग, और कर्म योग, निःस्वार्थ सेवा का सक्रिय मार्ग। ये योग के मूलभूत विभिन्न प्रकार हैं।",
    "अपना कर्म सदा दूसरों के कल्याण को ध्यान में रखकर करो। इसी कर्म से जनक ने सिद्धि प्राप्त की; अन्य लोगों ने भी इस मार्ग का अनुसरण किया है।",
    "हे अर्जुन, तीनों लोकों में मुझे पाने के लिए कुछ नहीं है, और न ही कुछ ऐसा है जो मेरे पास नहीं है; फिर भी मैं कर्म करता रहता हूं, परंतु मैं अपनी किसी आवश्यकता से प्रेरित नहीं हूं।",
    "अज्ञानी अपने लाभ के लिए काम करते हैं, हे अर्जुन; ज्ञानी संसार के कल्याण के लिए काम करते हैं, स्वयं के बारे में सोचे बिना।",
    "अपने धर्म में प्रयत्न करना श्रेयस्कर है, दूसरे के धर्म में सफल होने से। अपने धर्म का पालन करने में कभी कुछ नहीं खोता, परंतु दूसरे के धर्म में स्पर्धा भय और असुरक्षा उत्पन्न करती है।",
    "इंद्रियां शरीर से श्रेष्ठ हैं, मन इंद्रियों से श्रेष्ठ है; मन से ऊपर बुद्धि है, और बुद्धि से ऊपर आत्मा है। इस प्रकार, उस परम तत्व को जानकर, आत्मा को अहंकार पर शासन करने दो। अपनी शक्तिशाली भुजाओं से स्वार्थी इच्छा रूपी भयंकर शत्रु का वध करो।",
    "हे अर्जुन, तुम और मैं अनेक जन्मों से गुजर चुके हैं। तुम भूल गए हो, परंतु मुझे सब याद है।",
    "मेरा वास्तविक स्वरूप अजन्मा और अपरिवर्तनीय है। मैं भगवान हूं जो प्रत्येक प्राणी में निवास करता है। अपनी माया की शक्ति से मैं एक सीमित रूप में प्रकट होता हूं।",
    "जो मुझे अपनी दिव्य आत्मा के रूप में जानते हैं, वे इस विश्वास से मुक्त हो जाते हैं कि वे शरीर हैं और अलग प्राणी के रूप में पुनर्जन्म नहीं लेते। ऐसा व्यक्ति, हे अर्जुन, मेरे साथ एक हो जाता है।",
    "स्वार्थी आसक्ति, भय और क्रोध से मुक्त, मुझमें परिपूर्ण, मुझे समर्पित, मेरे अस्तित्व की अग्नि में शुद्ध होकर, अनेकों ने मेरे साथ एकता की अवस्था प्राप्त की है।",
    "कर्म मुझसे नहीं चिपकते क्योंकि मैं उनके फल से आसक्त नहीं हूं। जो इसे समझते हैं और इसका अभ्यास करते हैं, वे स्वतंत्रता में जीते हैं।",
    "ज्ञानी देखते हैं कि अकर्म के बीच में कर्म है और कर्म के बीच में अकर्म है। उनकी चेतना एकीकृत है, और हर कर्म पूर्ण जागरूकता के साथ किया जाता है।",
    "अर्पण की प्रक्रिया ब्रह्म है; जो अर्पित किया जाता है वह ब्रह्म है। ब्रह्म ही ब्रह्म की अग्नि में यज्ञ करता है। जो हर कर्म में ब्रह्म को देखते हैं, वे ब्रह्म को प्राप्त करते हैं।",
    "हे अर्जुन, ज्ञान का अर्पण किसी भी भौतिक अर्पण से श्रेष्ठ है; क्योंकि सभी कर्मों का लक्ष्य आध्यात्मिक ज्ञान है।",
    "जिन्होंने जीवन के उद्देश्य को जान लिया है, उनके पास जाओ और श्रद्धा एवं भक्ति से प्रश्न करो; वे तुम्हें इस ज्ञान में शिक्षित करेंगे।",
    "हे अर्जुन, यदि तुम सबसे बड़े पापी भी हो, तो भी तुम आध्यात्मिक ज्ञान की नौका से सभी पापों को पार कर सकते हो।",
    "कृष्ण अर्जुन को गीता प्रदान करते हैं।",
    "जैसे अग्नि की गर्मी लकड़ी को राख में बदल देती है, वैसे ही ज्ञान की अग्नि सभी कर्मों को राख में बदल देती है।",
    "जो सभी स्वार्थी आसक्तियों को ब्रह्म को समर्पित कर देते हैं, वे कमल के पत्ते की तरह जल में शुद्ध और सूखे तैरते हैं। पाप उन्हें छू नहीं सकता।",
    "जो अपने सभी कर्मों में आसक्ति का त्याग करते हैं, वे 'नौ द्वारों के शहर', शरीर में, उसके स्वामी के रूप में संतुष्ट रहते हैं। वे कर्म करने के लिए प्रेरित नहीं होते, और न ही दूसरों को कर्म में शामिल करते हैं।",
    "जिनके पास यह ज्ञान है, वे सभी के प्रति समान भाव रखते हैं। वे आध्यात्मिक साधक और चांडाल में, हाथी, गाय और कुत्ते में एक ही आत्मा को देखते हैं।",
    "इंद्रियों के संसार में उत्पन्न सुखों का एक आरंभ और एक अंत होता है और वे दुख को जन्म देते हैं, हे अर्जुन। बुद्धिमान उनमें सुख की खोज नहीं करते। परंतु जो शरीर में उत्पन्न काम और क्रोध के आवेगों पर विजय प्राप्त करते हैं, वे संपूर्ण होते हैं और आनंद में जीते हैं। वे अपना आनंद, अपनी शांति और अपना प्रकाश पूर्णतः अपने भीतर ही पाते हैं। भगवान के साथ एक होकर, वे ब्रह्म में निर्वाण प्राप्त करते हैं।",
    "क्रोध और स्वार्थी इच्छा से मुक्त, मन में एकीकृत, जो योग के मार्ग का अनुसरण करते हैं और आत्मा को जान लेते हैं, वे सदा के लिए उस परम अवस्था में स्थापित हो जाते हैं।",
    "मुझे सभी प्राणियों के मित्र, ब्रह्मांड के स्वामी, सभी अर्पणों और आध्यात्मिक अनुशासनों के लक्ष्य के रूप में जानकर, वे शाश्वत शांति प्राप्त करते हैं।",
    "जिनमें ऊर्जा की कमी है या जो कर्म से विरत रहते हैं, वे नहीं, बल्कि जो पुरस्कार की अपेक्षा के बिना कार्य करते हैं, वे ध्यान के लक्ष्य को प्राप्त करते हैं।",
    "जो अपने कर्मों के फल की आसक्ति का त्याग नहीं कर सकते, वे मार्ग से दूर हैं।",
    "अपनी इच्छा-शक्ति के बल पर स्वयं को नया रूप दो; स्वयं को कभी आत्म-इच्छा द्वारा पतित मत होने दो। इच्छा-शक्ति आत्मा का एकमात्र मित्र है, और इच्छा-शक्ति आत्मा का एकमात्र शत्रु भी है।",
    "जिन्होंने स्वयं पर विजय प्राप्त कर ली है, उनके लिए इच्छा-शक्ति मित्र है। परंतु जिन्होंने अपने भीतर आत्मा को नहीं पाया है, उनके लिए यह शत्रु है।",
    "जिन्होंने स्वयं पर विजय प्राप्त कर ली है, उनकी चेतना में परम सत्य प्रकट होता है। वे शांति में जीते हैं, सर्दी और गर्मी, सुख और दुख, प्रशंसा और निंदा में समान रहते हैं।",
    "सभी भयों को आत्मा की शांति में विलीन करके और सभी कर्मों को ब्रह्म को समर्पित करके, मन को नियंत्रित करके और उसे मुझमें स्थिर करके, मुझे अपने एकमात्र लक्ष्य के रूप में रखकर ध्यान में बैठो।",
    "हे अर्जुन, जो बहुत अधिक या बहुत कम खाते हैं, जो बहुत अधिक या बहुत कम सोते हैं, वे ध्यान में सफल नहीं होंगे। परंतु जो भोजन और नींद, कार्य और मनोरंजन में संयमी हैं, वे ध्यान के माध्यम से दुख के अंत तक पहुंचेंगे।",
    "शांत मन में, ध्यान की गहराई में, आत्मा स्वयं को प्रकट करती है। आत्मा के माध्यम से आत्मा को देखकर, एक साधक पूर्ण तृप्ति के आनंद और शांति को जानता है।",
    "जहां भी मन भटकता है, बाहर संतुष्टि की खोज में अस्थिर और विकीर्ण होकर, उसे भीतर लाओ; उसे आत्मा में विश्राम करने के लिए प्रशिक्षित करो।",
    "जिन्होंने प्रत्येक प्राणी में मुझे जान लिया है, मैं उनके लिए सदा उपस्थित हूं। सभी जीवन को मेरी अभिव्यक्ति के रूप में देखकर, वे कभी मुझसे अलग नहीं होते।",
    "जब कोई व्यक्ति दूसरों के सुख-दुख पर ऐसे प्रतिक्रिया करता है जैसे वे उसके अपने हों, तो उसने आध्यात्मिक एकता की सर्वोच्च अवस्था प्राप्त कर ली है।",
    "कोई भी व्यक्ति जो अच्छा काम करता है, उसका बुरा अंत कभी नहीं होता, न यहां और न ही आने वाले संसार में।",
    "अनेक जन्मों में निरंतर प्रयास से, एक व्यक्ति सभी स्वार्थी इच्छाओं से शुद्ध हो जाता है और जीवन के परम लक्ष्य को प्राप्त करता है।",
    "ध्यान कठोर तपस्या और ज्ञान के मार्ग से श्रेष्ठ है। यह निःस्वार्थ सेवा से भी श्रेष्ठ है। हे अर्जुन, तुम ध्यान के लक्ष्य को प्राप्त करो।",
    "ध्यान करने वालों में भी, जो पुरुष या स्त्री पूर्ण श्रद्धा से मुझमें पूर्णतः लीन होकर मेरी पूजा करते हैं, वे योग में सबसे दृढ़ता से स्थापित हैं।",
    "हे अर्जुन, अपने मन को मुझमें स्थिर करके, योग के अभ्यास से स्वयं को अनुशासित करो। पूर्णतः मुझ पर निर्भर रहो। सुनो, और मैं तुम्हारे सभी संदेहों को दूर कर दूंगा; तुम मुझे पूर्णतः जान लोगे और मेरे साथ एक हो जाओगे।",
    "सृष्टि का जन्म और विघटन मुझमें ही होता है। हे अर्जुन, मुझसे अलग कुछ भी नहीं है। संपूर्ण ब्रह्मांड मुझसे ऐसे लटका है जैसे रत्नों की माला।",
    "हे अर्जुन, मैं शुद्ध जल का स्वाद हूं और सूर्य और चंद्रमा की चमक हूं। मैं पवित्र शब्द हूं और वायु में सुनी जाने वाली ध्वनि हूं, और मनुष्यों का साहस हूं। मैं पृथ्वी में मीठी सुगंध हूं और अग्नि की चमक हूं; मैं प्रत्येक प्राणी में जीवन हूं और आध्यात्मिक साधक का प्रयास हूं।",
    "हे अर्जुन, मेरा शाश्वत बीज प्रत्येक प्राणी में पाया जाता है। मैं बुद्धिमानों में विवेक की शक्ति हूं, और महान लोगों की महिमा हूं। जो शक्तिशाली हैं, उनमें मैं शक्ति हूं, काम और स्वार्थी आसक्ति से मुक्त। मैं स्वयं इच्छा हूं, यदि वह इच्छा जीवन के उद्देश्य के अनुरूप है।",
    "सत्व, रजस और तमस की अवस्थाएं मुझसे आती हैं, परंतु मैं उनमें नहीं हूं।",
    "ये तीन गुण मेरी दिव्य माया बनाते हैं, जिसे पार करना कठिन है। परंतु जो मेरी शरण लेते हैं, वे इस माया को पार कर जाते हैं।",
    "कुछ लोग दुख के कारण आध्यात्मिक जीवन में आते हैं, कुछ जीवन को समझने के लिए; कुछ जीवन के उद्देश्य को प्राप्त करने की इच्छा से आते हैं, और कुछ ऐसे पुरुष और स्त्रियां आते हैं जो ज्ञानी हैं। अडिग भक्ति में, सदा मेरे साथ एक होकर, ज्ञानी पुरुष या स्त्री सभी से श्रेष्ठ है।",
    "अनेक जन्मों के बाद ज्ञानी मेरी शरण में आते हैं, मुझे सर्वत्र और सब में देखते हुए। ऐसी महान आत्माएं बहुत दुर्लभ हैं।",
    "संसार, भ्रमित होकर, यह नहीं जानता कि मैं अजन्मा और अपरिवर्तनीय हूं। हे अर्जुन, मैं भूत, वर्तमान और भविष्य के बारे में सब कुछ जानता हूं; परंतु कोई भी मुझे पूर्णतः नहीं जानता।",
    "आकर्षण और विकर्षण की द्वैतता से भ्रम उत्पन्न होता है, हे अर्जुन; हर प्राणी जन्म से ही इनसे भ्रमित होता है।",
    "जो मुझे ब्रह्मांड पर शासन करते हुए देखते हैं, जो मुझे अधिभूत, अधिदैव और अधियज्ञ में देखते हैं, वे मृत्यु के समय भी मेरे प्रति सचेत रहते हैं।",
    "भगवान परम कवि हैं, प्रथम कारण हैं, संप्रभु शासक हैं, सबसे सूक्ष्म कण से भी सूक्ष्म हैं, सबके आधार हैं, अकल्पनीय हैं, सूर्य की तरह उज्ज्वल हैं, अंधकार से परे हैं।",
    "मृत्यु के समय मुझे स्मरण करते हुए, इंद्रियों के द्वारों को बंद करो और मन को हृदय में स्थापित करो। फिर, ध्यान में लीन होकर, सभी ऊर्जा को सिर की ओर ले जाओ। इस अवस्था में दिव्य नाम, अक्षर ॐ जो अपरिवर्तनीय ब्रह्म का प्रतिनिधित्व करता है, का जप करते हुए, तुम शरीर से निकलकर परम लक्ष्य को प्राप्त करोगे।",
    "जो व्यक्ति सदा मुझे स्मरण करता है और किसी और से आसक्त नहीं है, मैं उसे सहजता से प्राप्त होता हूं। ऐसा व्यक्ति सच्चा योगी है, हे अर्जुन।",
    "हे अर्जुन, ब्रह्मांड में हर प्राणी पुनर्जन्म के अधीन है, सिवाय उसके जो मेरे साथ एक है।",
    "सूर्य के उत्तरायण के छह महीने, प्रकाश का मार्ग, अग्नि का मार्ग, दिन का मार्ग, शुक्ल पक्ष का मार्ग, ब्रह्म के ज्ञाताओं को परम लक्ष्य की ओर ले जाता है। सूर्य के दक्षिणायन के छह महीने, धुएं का मार्ग, रात का मार्ग, कृष्ण पक्ष का मार्ग, अन्य आत्माओं को चंद्रमा के प्रकाश और पुनर्जन्म की ओर ले जाता है।",
    "मेरी सतर्क निगाह के अधीन प्रकृति के नियम अपना मार्ग लेते हैं। इस प्रकार संसार गति में आता है; इस प्रकार चेतन और अचेतन की रचना होती है।",
    "मैं ही अनुष्ठान और यज्ञ हूं; मैं ही सच्ची औषधि और मंत्र हूं। मैं ही अर्पण और उसे ग्रहण करने वाली अग्नि हूं, और वह भी जिसे यह अर्पित किया जाता है।",
    "मैं इस ब्रह्मांड का पिता और माता हूं, और इसका दादा भी हूं; मैं इसका संपूर्ण आधार हूं। मैं सभी ज्ञान का योग हूं, शुद्ध करने वाला हूं, अक्षर ॐ हूं; मैं ही पवित्र शास्त्र हूं, ऋग्वेद, यजुर्वेद और सामवेद।",
    "मैं जीवन का लक्ष्य हूं, सभी का स्वामी और आधार हूं, आंतरिक साक्षी हूं, निवास स्थान हूं। मैं ही एकमात्र शरणस्थली हूं, एक सच्चा मित्र हूं; मैं सृष्टि का आरंभ, स्थिति और अंत हूं; मैं गर्भ हूं और शाश्वत बीज हूं।",
    "जो वेदों में दिए गए अनुष्ठानों का पालन करते हैं, जो यज्ञ करते हैं और सोम पीते हैं, वे पाप से मुक्त होकर देवताओं के विशाल स्वर्ग को प्राप्त करते हैं, जहां वे दिव्य सुखों का आनंद लेते हैं। जब वे इन्हें पूर्णतः भोग लेते हैं, उनका पुण्य समाप्त हो जाता है और वे इस मृत्यु के देश में लौट आते हैं। इस प्रकार वैदिक अनुष्ठानों का पालन करते हुए परंतु इच्छाओं की अंतहीन श्रृंखला में फंसे हुए, वे आते-जाते रहते हैं।",
    "जो मेरी पूजा करते हैं और निरंतर मेरा ध्यान करते हैं, किसी अन्य विचार के बिना - मैं उनकी सभी आवश्यकताओं की पूर्ति करता हूं।",
    "जो देवताओं की पूजा करते हैं, वे देवताओं के लोक को जाएंगे; जो अपने पूर्वजों की पूजा करते हैं, वे मृत्यु के बाद उनके साथ एक होंगे। जो भूतों की पूजा करते हैं, वे भूत बन जाएंगे; परंतु मेरे भक्त मेरे पास आएंगे।",
    "अपने मन को मुझसे भरो; मुझसे प्रेम करो; मेरी सेवा करो; सदा मेरी पूजा करो। अपने हृदय में मुझे खोजते हुए, तुम अंततः मेरे साथ एक हो जाओगे।",
    "सभी शास्त्र मेरी ओर ले जाते हैं; मैं उनका लेखक और उनका ज्ञान हूं।",
    "भीष्म, द्रोण, जयद्रथ, कर्ण और कई अन्य पहले ही मारे जा चुके हैं। उन्हें मारो जिन्हें मैं मार चुका हूं। संकोच मत करो। इस युद्ध में लड़ो और तुम अपने शत्रुओं पर विजय प्राप्त करोगे।",
    "वेदों के ज्ञान से, न यज्ञ से, न दान से, न अनुष्ठानों से, न ही कठोर तपस्या से किसी अन्य नश्वर ने वह देखा है जो तुमने देखा है, हे वीर अर्जुन।",
    "यांत्रिक अभ्यास से ज्ञान श्रेष्ठ है। ज्ञान से ध्यान श्रेष्ठ है। परंतु सबसे श्रेष्ठ है फल की आसक्ति का त्याग, क्योंकि उसके बाद तुरंत शांति मिलती है।",
    "कुछ लोग ध्यान के अभ्यास से अपने भीतर आत्मा को जान लेते हैं, कुछ ज्ञान के मार्ग से, और अन्य निःस्वार्थ सेवा से। अन्य लोग इन मार्गों को नहीं जान सकते; परंतु एक प्रबुद्ध शिक्षक के निर्देशों को सुनकर और उनका पालन करके, वे भी मृत्यु से परे चले जाते हैं।",
    "सूर्य की चमक, जो संसार को प्रकाशित करती है, चंद्रमा की चमक और अग्नि की चमक - ये मेरी महिमा हैं।",
    "शांति, कोमलता, मौन, आत्म-संयम और शुद्धता: ये मन के अनुशासन हैं।",
    "स्वार्थी कर्मों से विरत रहना एक प्रकार का त्याग है, जिसे संन्यास कहते हैं; कर्म के फल का त्याग करना दूसरा है, जिसे त्याग कहते हैं।",
    "अडिग प्रेम से मेरी सेवा करके, पुरुष या स्त्री गुणों से परे चला जाता है। ऐसा व्यक्ति ब्रह्म के साथ एकता के योग्य है।",
    "जब वे सृष्टि की विविधता को उस एकता में निहित और उसी से विकसित होते हुए देखते हैं, तब वे ब्रह्म में तृप्ति प्राप्त करते हैं।",
    "हे अर्जुन, मैंने तुम्हारे साथ यह गहन सत्य साझा किया है। जो इसे समझेंगे, वे ज्ञान प्राप्त करेंगे; उन्होंने वह कर लिया होगा जो करना था।",
    "मैं तुम्हें ज्ञान के ये अनमोल शब्द देता हूं; इन पर विचार करो और फिर जैसा तुम चाहो वैसा करो।",
